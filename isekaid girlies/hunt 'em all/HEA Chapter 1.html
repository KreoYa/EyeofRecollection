        Division 8 of The Mist Special Investigation Unit has always been a
        laidback workplace, with it being placed in a considerably remote place
        with little to no action for their line of work. Until a powerful demon
        appeared with intelligence and cunning when they least expect it.

        Very heavily inspired by Chainsaw Man and Special Civil Servant
        (ESPECIALLY Special Civil Servant)! Dungeon AUs are complicated with
        their items and stuff lmao so I decided for this AU instead.

    <!-- WORK STARTS HERE -->
    <div class="work">
      <p>
        Clacks of multiple keyboards echoed throughout the small office room.
        The shine of the sun partially blocked by the curtains, leaving rays
        still going through for the strategically placed potted plants. Clock
        ticking admist the shuffles of the stacks of papers that are on almost
        each of the staff’s table, with the printer ejecting more paper.
      </p>
      <p>
        Grunts and frustrated sighs were heard a couple of times before it was
        broken by a small ding of the digital clock situated nearest to the
        manager’s— or Heinrich’s table.
      </p>
      <p>
        Heinrich looked over to the clock and knocked three times on his table,
        bringing everyone’s attention to him.
      </p>
      <p>“30 minutes until daily patrol. Three people should be enough.”</p>
      <p>
        Yura stood up to looked over to the blonde and faced him. Her chair
        squeaking against the floor. “We usually send out only two for daily
        patrols, is something the matter?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Heinrich gave a sigh and massaged his temples. As he did so he answered,
        “There has been reports from other divisions of more demons appearing in
        the mist, instead of just one.” He paused and stopped rubbing his
        temples, before continuing, “Although rare and the levels have been all
        low in those cases, we still need to be cautious.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The room went silent for a period until another squeak of chair was
        heard. Sybill took her dagger from the weapon rack. Yura joined her and
        grabbed her own spear.
      </p>
      <p>“Today was Yura’s and my turn for patrol. Who’s the third person?”</p>
      <p>
        Heinrich stayed silent and glanced over to the man that has been
        bothering Alka. He took notice and cocked his head torwards Heinrich.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yes you, Cassian. You’re the only close ranged staff that has not done
        patrol this week.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Cassian shrugged and stood up from his seat, joining the two girls who
        has been on standby. He grabbed his double-headed spear.
