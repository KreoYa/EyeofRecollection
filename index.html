    <p>A specialized page for your resident procrastinator!</p>
    <p>
      This site is created to manage all my OCs, worlds, and many more that I
      definitely thought of and have written content of. It will contain worlds,
      characters, and writings from all different kind of fandoms, and even
      original. I will be updating more of this to manage my thoughts. Some
      information may be added, changed, or removed at any time.

      Do be warned that they may be triggering topics and/or upsetting themes in
      my writing that may have been missed in the tags. Please contact me
      whenever you encounter them for a better experience.
